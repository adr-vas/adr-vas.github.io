# Adrian Vasquez
**Industrial Engineer | Operations Analyst | Data-Driven Problem Solver**

Born and raised in San Francisco, I have always maintained a deep interest in science and engineering. Deconstructing problems and solving them represents the fundamental way my mind approaches challenges.

My engineering journey began in high school working in the Machine Shop at the Exploratorium, an interactive science and technology museum. I spent countless hours taking apart exhibits to rebuild and repair them, developing an intuitive understanding of how complex systems function.

After cultivating hands-on problem-solving experience, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research with a Minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley. This academic foundation transformed my inclinations for tinkering into a sophisticated skillset focused on modeling and optimizing complex processes at scale, while providing deep appreciation and understanding for extracting meaningful insights from large datasets.
