<p><strong>L’Oréal USA Supply Chain Data Analytics Team | Summer 2024</strong></p>

<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

<p>During my summer internship with L’Oréal USA’s Supply Chain Data Analytics team, I served as a key contributor to enterprise-scale data infrastructure modernization initiatives. Working within the Operations department, I collaborated with cross-functional teams across master planning, supply planning, demand planning, manufacturing, and marketing divisions to deliver data-driven solutions that enhanced operational efficiency for the world’s leading beauty company.</p>

<p>This project represented a comprehensive approach to modernizing legacy data systems while establishing scalable analytics capabilities that would serve L’Oréal’s global operations for years to come. The technical challenges required balancing enterprise system constraints with the need for real-time analytics and actionable insights across multiple business units.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="technical-architecture--implementation">Technical Architecture &amp; Implementation</h2>

<h3 id="data-migration-and-infrastructure-modernization">Data Migration and Infrastructure Modernization</h3>

<p>The cornerstone of this project involved migrating critical operational data from L’Oréal’s legacy systems, including Enterprise Information Warehouse (EIW) and SAP platforms, to modern Google Cloud infrastructure. This migration required careful coordination across international teams and represented a fundamental shift in how the organization approaches data accessibility and analytics capabilities.</p>

<p>The technical complexity of this migration centered on maintaining data integrity while transforming information structures to support enhanced analytics workflows. Working closely with overseas development teams, I contributed to establishing data pipelines that would enable real-time analysis capabilities while preserving the historical context essential for supply chain planning operations.</p>

<p>This infrastructure modernization created the foundation for advanced analytics applications across multiple departments, establishing L’Oréal’s capability to leverage cloud-based analytics tools for improved decision-making across global operations.</p>

<h3 id="dashboard-development-and-data-visualization">Dashboard Development and Data Visualization</h3>

<p>I led the development of comprehensive PowerBI dashboards designed to serve diverse stakeholder groups across L’Oréal’s supply chain operations. These dashboards required understanding the distinct analytical needs of master planning, supply planning, demand planning, manufacturing, and marketing teams while creating unified visualization frameworks that facilitated cross-functional collaboration.</p>

<p>The primary dashboard application focused on identifying and addressing data quality issues within critical operational documents, specifically targeting the 1081 master data sheet. This system enabled operations teams to quickly identify incorrect master data inputs that could impact supply chain efficiency, transforming a previously manual and time-intensive process into an automated quality assurance workflow.</p>

<p>Dashboard design emphasized actionable insights rather than simply displaying data. Each visualization component was designed to suggest specific corrective actions while providing the contextual information necessary for operations teams to understand underlying causes and implement sustainable solutions.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-data-transformations">Advanced Data Transformations</h3>

<p>Creating effective analytics capabilities required developing sophisticated data transformation processes that could handle the complexity of L’Oréal’s global operations while maintaining accuracy and performance standards. These transformations bridged legacy system outputs with modern analytics requirements, enabling seamless integration between historical operational data and real-time decision-making tools.</p>

<p>The transformation framework incorporated business logic specific to beauty industry supply chain operations, ensuring that automated processes aligned with established operational procedures while enhancing rather than disrupting existing workflows. This approach required deep understanding of supply chain planning methodologies and close collaboration with domain experts across multiple departments.</p>

<p>These data transformations established the technical foundation for accurate, efficient reporting across international operations, enabling teams to access consistent analytical insights regardless of geographic location or specific operational focus area.</p>

<h2 id="business-impact-and-operational-results">Business Impact and Operational Results</h2>

<h3 id="cross-departmental-analytics-integration">Cross-Departmental Analytics Integration</h3>

<p>The dashboard and analytics systems I developed provided immediate value across multiple L’Oréal divisions, demonstrating the power of unified data infrastructure to enhance collaboration and decision-making capabilities. Master planning teams gained enhanced visibility into demand forecasting accuracy, while supply planning operations could quickly identify potential bottlenecks and resource allocation opportunities.</p>

<p>Manufacturing teams utilized the analytics platform to optimize production scheduling based on real-time demand signals, while marketing divisions gained access to supply chain insights that informed promotional planning and product launch strategies. This cross-functional integration represented a significant advancement in L’Oréal’s data-driven operational capabilities.</p>

<p>The project’s success demonstrated how thoughtful analytics implementation can bridge traditional organizational silos, enabling more effective collaboration between departments that previously operated with limited visibility into each other’s operational constraints and opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="data-quality-and-process-improvement">Data Quality and Process Improvement</h3>

<p>The automated master data quality assurance system provided immediate operational benefits by identifying data accuracy issues that could have significant downstream impacts on supply chain efficiency. By transforming manual data validation processes into automated workflows, the system reduced the time required for quality assurance while improving accuracy and consistency across global operations.</p>

<p>This improvement in data quality had cascading positive effects throughout L’Oréal’s supply chain operations, enabling more accurate demand forecasting, improved inventory management, and enhanced production planning capabilities. The system’s ability to identify issues proactively rather than reactively represented a fundamental improvement in operational risk management.</p>

<p>The analytics platform established L’Oréal’s capability to maintain high data quality standards while scaling operations, ensuring that growth in operational complexity would not compromise the accuracy of critical decision-making information.</p>
