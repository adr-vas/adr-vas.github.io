<p><strong>Industrial Engineer | Operations Analyst | Data-Driven Problem Solver</strong></p>

<p>Born and raised in San Francisco, I have always maintained a deep interest in science and engineering. Deconstructing problems and solving them represents the fundamental way my mind approaches challenges.</p>

<p>My engineering journey began in high school working in the Machine Shop at the Exploratorium, an interactive science and technology museum. I spent countless hours taking apart exhibits to rebuild and repair them, developing an intuitive understanding of how complex systems function.</p>

<p>After cultivating hands-on problem-solving experience, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research with a Minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley. This academic foundation transformed my inclinations for tinkering into a sophisticated skillset focused on modeling and optimizing complex processes at scale, while providing deep appreciation and understanding for extracting meaningful insights from large datasets.</p>
