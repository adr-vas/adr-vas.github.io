## Professional Overview

My approach to engineering problems stems from a fundamental curiosity about how systems work and how they can work better. This perspective, developed through years of hands-on problem solving, drives my work in data analytics and operations optimization across diverse industries.

I specialize in transforming operational challenges into data-driven solutions, with particular expertise in real-time analytics for high-stakes environments. My experience spans entertainment operations, supply chain management, and fleet optimization, consistently focusing on building systems that enhance decision-making capabilities rather than replacing human expertise.

## Education

### University of California, Berkeley
**Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research**  
*Minor in Data Science*  
**August 2020 - December 2024**

My academic foundation provided the theoretical framework to transform hands-on problem-solving instincts into systematic approaches for complex systems optimization. The Industrial Engineering curriculum emphasized understanding interconnected processes, while the Data Science minor equipped me with advanced analytical tools for extracting actionable insights from large datasets.

The program's emphasis on mathematical modeling and statistical analysis proved essential for my later work in supply chain analytics and real-time operational optimization. Key coursework included Operations Research, Database Systems, Machine Learning Applications, and Supply Chain Management.

## Professional Experience

### Another Planet Entertainment - Berkeley, CA

**Data Analytics Specialist** | *April 2025 - Present*

My role centers on transforming four years of festival data into operational intelligence for large-scale events. Working directly with the Head of Festival Operations, I developed comprehensive analytics frameworks that inform deployment decisions for over 50 staff members and more than 100 pieces of specialized equipment for Outside Lands 2025.

The technical challenge involved creating predictive models from historical attendance patterns, weather data, and operational metrics. I built automated reporting workflows that process real-time scan data from events with 50,000+ daily attendees, enabling operations teams to make critical staffing and security adjustments within minutes rather than hours.

For Dead & Company's three-day Golden Gate Park run, I analyzed crowd flow patterns and security protocols for 60,000+ total attendees. The insights directly improved operational efficiency for high-capacity outdoor events, particularly in areas of ingress management and crowd density optimization.

**Venue Operations** | *February 2025 - Present*

Daily operations management across three large-scale venues provided essential context for my analytical work. This hands-on experience managing event logistics, coordinating staff, and resolving real-time operational challenges fundamentally informed how I design data systems and dashboards.

Understanding the immediate decision-making pressures during live events shaped my approach to building analytics tools that serve operational teams effectively. This ground-level experience ensures that my data solutions address actual workflow needs rather than theoretical optimizations.

**Business Operations** | *October 2024 - May 2025*

Administrative operations management included coordinating communication systems, managing documentation workflows, and analyzing patron data from major events. I developed automation solutions that reduced manual processing time by 40%, specifically for archival and cataloging procedures.

Cross-functional analysis projects included examining Outside Lands patron entry and exit patterns to optimize VIP distribution and improve future event layouts. This work required translating complex datasets into actionable recommendations for multiple stakeholder groups with varying analytical backgrounds.

### L'Oréal USA - New York, NY
**Supply Chain Data Analytics Team** | *Summer 2024*

The internship focused on modernizing data infrastructure for global supply chain operations. I led the migration of legacy data from SAP and EIW systems to Google Cloud Platform, establishing enhanced data accessibility and enabling real-time analytics capabilities across multiple departments.

Dashboard development for supply, demand, and master planning teams required understanding diverse workflow requirements and creating unified visualization frameworks. The technical challenge involved designing data transformations that maintained accuracy while improving reporting efficiency across international operations.

Collaboration with global teams and stakeholders in an agile environment provided valuable experience balancing technical capabilities with business requirements. Working under the guidance of experienced supply chain professionals, I learned to translate complex analytical insights into recommendations that aligned with operational realities.

The project required careful coordination with team members including my manager Anil Vegesna, leadership from Lisa Kaytor and Michael Wachtel, and technical collaboration with Robert K. on dashboard implementation. This experience reinforced the importance of building technical solutions that enhance existing expertise rather than disrupting established workflows.

### Duffl - San Francisco, CA
**Head of Operations and Equipment** | *August 2023 - June 2024*

Fleet operations management required rapid scaling under resource constraints. I increased the operational scooter fleet from 2 to 12 units within two months while maintaining service continuity during a critical growth period.

Vendor relationship development proved essential for reducing equipment downtime by 30%. This involved establishing supply chain partnerships that could support rapid scaling while maintaining cost efficiency and service reliability.

Asset management system implementation tracked $20,000 worth of equipment, reducing asset loss by 25%. The system design focused on scalability, anticipating future fleet expansion while providing immediate operational visibility and control.

## Technical Capabilities

### Programming and Analysis
My technical toolkit centers on Python for data analysis and automation, with emphasis on writing maintainable code that supports collaborative workflows. SQL expertise focuses on scalable query design for both ad-hoc analysis and automated reporting systems.

MATLAB and R serve specialized roles for mathematical optimization and statistical analysis when projects require capabilities beyond standard Python libraries. Java proficiency supports enterprise system integration and object-oriented development requirements.

### Visualization and Communication
PowerBI development emphasizes creating dashboards that guide decision-making rather than simply displaying data. I design visualizations that suggest actionable responses and facilitate stakeholder understanding across technical and non-technical audiences.

Excel remains valuable for collaborative analysis environments where stakeholders need direct data interaction capabilities. Google Cloud Platform experience includes hands-on migration project management and cloud-based analytics implementation.

### Database and Systems Management
MySQL, SAP, and Google BigQuery experience spans both operational database management and complex data integration projects. This includes working with legacy enterprise systems and modern cloud-based analytics platforms.
