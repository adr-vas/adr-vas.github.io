# About Me

Born and raised in San Francisco, I've always had an interest in science and engineering. Reframing problems as puzzles waiting to be solved them has always been how my brain works and approaches challenges. 

I started my journey with engineering in High School working in the Machine Shop at the Exploratorium, an interactive science and technology museum. I'd spend hours taking apart exhibits to rebuild and repair them.

After developing my hands-on problem-solving experience, I pursued a Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research with a Minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley. This took my inclinations for tinkering and transformed it to a skillset focused on modeling and optimizing complex processes at scale. I also gained a deep appreciation and understanding for how to work with big data to gain meaningful insights.
